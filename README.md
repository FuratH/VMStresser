# VMStresser

**VMStresser** is a Java-based tool designed to simulate stress conditions on virtual machines (VMs). It facilitates performance benchmarking by applying configurable workloads, aiding in the evaluation of VM resilience and resource management under load.

## Features

- Customizable stress scenarios to simulate various load conditions.
- Logging capabilities to monitor performance metrics and system behavior.
- Shell script (`run.sh`) for streamlined execution.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher.
- Maven for building the project.
- A Unix-like environment to execute the shell script.

## Building the Project

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:


```bash
git clone https://github.com/FuratH/VMStresser.git
cd VMStresser
```


Use Maven to build the project:


```bash
mvn clean package
```


## Running VMStresser

Execute the provided shell script to start the stress test:


```bash
./run.sh
```


This script initiates the Java application with the necessary parameters.

## Output

Upon execution, VMStresser generates the following files:

- `metrics.log`: Logs containing performance metrics during the stress test.
- `stresser.log`: Detailed logs of the stress test execution.
- `stresser_report.txt`: Summary report of the stress test outcomes.
